### About Me 
I'm an AI & Automation Engineer passionate about building scalable, intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. With hands-on experience in Python, TypeScript, CI/CD, GitLab, and Agentic AI frameworks like AutoGen and CrewAI, I specialize in creating end-to-end Intelligent Software Solutions, from Designing to Deployment.

I’ve built impactful GenAI applications such as RAG-based document assistants, health prediction platforms, and multilingual voice interfaces, integrating LLMs, LangChain, FastAPI, and Streamlit. Currently, I work as an Automation Engineer at PTC, where I focus on streamlining engineering workflows, building scalable automation solutions, and contributing to CI/CD pipeline optimization for better operational efficiency.

I’m constantly learning and sharing through technical blogs, open-source contributions, and side projects, driven by a goal to turn emerging AI technologies into production-ready tools.
Always open to connecting with innovators building impactful AI systems or scaling intelligent automation.
